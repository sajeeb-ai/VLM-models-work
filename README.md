In this project, I am using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to classify the severity of lumbar spine stenosis from MRI scans. Using a dataset of over 8,000 images, I’ve categorized them into different grades ranging from Grade A (mild) to Grade D (severe).

The main focus of my work is data efficiency. I’m running comparisons to see how a "few-shot" learning approach—using only a tiny handful of samples—stacks up against training on the entire dataset by BiomedCLIP model. By measuring the accuracy gap between these two methods, I’m evaluating whether these advanced models can still deliver reliable results even in scenarios where thousands of labeled examples aren't available.
